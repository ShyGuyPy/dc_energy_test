I've pushed data to sqlite and postgres servers, but never from a pandas dataframe(I usually
handle data in R.  As such, I don't know the next step off hand.
It would probably look something like the function below which I have never used, and pulled
from https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html

DataFrame.to_sql(name, con, schema=None, if_exists='fail', index=True, index_label=None, chunksize=None, dtype=None, method=None)[source]

#get the averages in descending order
SELECT Year, Ave
FROM inflation_data
ORDER BY Ave DESC;
